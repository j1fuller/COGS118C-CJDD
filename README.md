# Alzheimer's EEG Analysis

This project analyzes EEG data from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and healthy controls.

## Dataset

We use the "A Dataset of Scalp EEG Recordings of Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Healthy Subjects from Routine EEG" from OpenNeuro (ds004504).

Dataset includes:
- 10 Alzheimer's disease patients
- 10 Frontotemporal Dementia patients
- 10 healthy controls

## Methods

We perform power spectral analysis to compare the power in alpha and gamma bands between the different groups.
