# Alzheimer's EEG Analysis

This project analyzes EEG data from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and healthy controls.

## Dataset

We use the "A Dataset of Scalp EEG Recordings of Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Healthy Subjects from Routine EEG" from OpenNeuro (ds004504).

Dataset includes:
- 36 Alzheimer's disease patients
- 23 Frontotemporal Dementia patients
- 29 healthy controls

## Methods

We perform power spectral analysis to compare the power in alpha and gamma bands between the different groups.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the dataset from OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504
3. Place the dataset in a `data/ds004504` directory
4. Run the notebook
